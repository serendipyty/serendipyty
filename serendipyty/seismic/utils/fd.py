def fdtaylorcoeff(k, xbar, x):
    """Compute coefficients for finite difference approximation.

    Compute coefficients for finite difference approximation for the
    derivative of order k at xbar based on grid values at points in x.

    Notes
    -----
    This function returns a row vector c of dimension 1 by n, where n=length(x),
    containing coefficients to approximate :math:`u^{(k)}(xbar)`,
    the k'th derivative of u evaluated at xbar,  based on n values
    of u at x(1), x(2), ... x(n).
    If U is a column vector containing u(x) at these n points, then
    c*U will give the approximation to :math:`u^{(k)}(xbar)`.
    Note for k=0 this can be used to evaluate the interpolating polynomial
    itself.
    Requires length(x) > k.
    Usually the elements x(i) are monotonically increasing
    and x(1) <= xbar <= x(n), but neither condition is required.
    The x values need not be equally spaced but must be distinct.
    This program should give the same results as fdcoeffV.m, but for large
    values of n is much more stable numerically.
    Based on the program "weights" in [1]_.

    Note: Forberg's algorithm can be used to simultaneously compute the
    coefficients for derivatives of order 0, 1, ..., m where m <= n-1.
    This gives a coefficient matrix C(1:n,1:m) whose k'th column gives
    the coefficients for the k'th derivative.
    In this version we set m=k and only compute the coefficients for
    derivatives of order up to order k, and then return only the k'th column
    of the resulting C matrix (converted to a row vector).
    This routine is then compatible with fdcoeffV.
    It can be easily modified to return the whole array if desired.
