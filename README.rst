Serendipyty is a Python library for learning and teaching Geophysics.
The goal of this project is to introduce the concept of
reproducible computational science to students with little or no programming experience.
Using Python and Jupyter, the purpose of this project is to present students
with an understanding of the role computation can play in providing reproducible
and verifiable answers to scientific questions arising from various fields of physical sciences.
